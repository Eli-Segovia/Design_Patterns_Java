# Design Patterns in JaVA

This repo serves as notes for writing design patterns in Java. These notes are very similar to my notes at [this repo](https://github.com/Eli-Segovia/Design_Patterns_JS), which is JavaScript.

I find myself in a situation where I will be using Java a lot more, so while I re-familiarize myself with Java, I will be keeping these Design Patterns in mind.
